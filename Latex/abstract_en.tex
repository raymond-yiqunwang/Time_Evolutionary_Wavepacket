Time propagation operator in time-dependent quantum-mechanical methods was constructed with hamiltonian of one-dimensional harmonic oscillator system. Properties of time propagation of different systems under our operator have been studied. $sinc$ functions were set to be basis functionals, and hamiltonian matrix in Hilbert space was established accordingly. Chebyshev scheme and diagonalizatin method were used to represent the evolution operator, and we studied relevant factors such as sampling points, terms of Chebyshev expansion and time scale. We are going to use Fourier basis as well as better approximation methods to achieve higher precision, and try to calculate Raman Spectra with the time propagation operator.
